Hello! This is a project by Casey Chartier, or Mustybraid if you prefer. My Github is located at https://github.com/MustyBraid and I can be reached by email at chartiercasey@gmail.com.

This project is pretty complicated! It uses openDb from idb, webpack, babel, and webpack's workbox module to store user-generated html to a database AND cache it so it can be retrieved locally without an internet connection.

It's not currently deployed to Heroku as Heroku only has a few more weeks of being a free service, but this is okay as it's very easy to install and use locally. the scripts available from npm defined in the package.json's allow the entire webpack project to be set up with just two lines of cli code.
